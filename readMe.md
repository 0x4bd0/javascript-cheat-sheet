Create a document using kebab-case in the `pages/` directory.  Make sure it's a markdown file, with the extension `.md`.  An example would be `data-types.md` as a document that covers JavaScript datatypes.

Once you add a file, start writing in it.  Make sure to use the layout shown in the `template.md` file in the root of this repository.
